If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
--------------------
Every pythagorean triple can be uniquely written in the form k(m^2 - n^2), 2kmn, k(m^2 + n^2) with m > n, gcd(m,n) = 1, and m,n of opposite parity
The perimeter is p = 2km(m + n), so p is even, then we want the number of solutions to km(m + n) = s, where s = 0, 1, 2, ..., 500 is the semiperimeter
